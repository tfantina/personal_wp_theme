# Personal WP Theme
###  Or TF Blog 2017 🐳
#### version 2.1.2
---
I designed this mostly in the summer of 2017 for a redo of my personal website.  It was my first shot at making a WordPress template and I'd be remiss if I didn't give kudos to
[Tania Rascia](https://www.taniarascia.com/developing-a-wordpress-theme-from-scratch/) for her tutorial as well as the fantastic [WordPress Documentation](https://codex.wordpress.org/Main_Page), which helped me through it. 👏

While I am fairly happy with the functionality there are some known issues which I am addressing.

1. Design fixes (to make it more attractive)
2. Several changes to bring it up to WP standards as a real theme


I'll be updating as time goes on.
